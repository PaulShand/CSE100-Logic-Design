This lab was very similar to the last lab except this time we used multiplexers to do most tasks compared to the
last lab where we used trivial logic. For example our Full adder was made of two 4 to 1
Multiplexers and our hex 7 seg was made up of seven 8 to 1 multiplexers. The end result was
the board being able to show a 8 bit number and being able to add a 2 bit number to it which
was properly carried out.
