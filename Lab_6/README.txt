This lab objective was to utilize a state machine in order to simulate a
turkey counter using laser detectors to count turkey passing through a corridor. Sadly
we didnâ€™t have the material to actually use the laser so we simulated it using buttons.
The board showed how many turkeys in total went right or left (negative or positive)
and how long the turkey stood in front of the laser. This was simply made by reusing
old code from the previous lab and most of the challenge came from the freedom in
building our system since no already made design was given to us which made this
project by far my favorite.
