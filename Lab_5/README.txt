utilize a state machine in order to make a
game onto the board with the controls being the button. The game itself would
generate a random number onto a board and then have a second number count up
every .25 sec. The goal of the game is to press the button in time to get the two
numbers matching in a tight window to do so. This was done using a state machine,
an LFSR and a counter with hex7seg display that was previously made in another
lab.
