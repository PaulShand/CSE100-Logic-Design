# Project Description

## Flappy Bird Recreation in Verilog and Vivado

### Overview
In this culminating lab, we leveraged our comprehensive knowledge of Vivado and Verilog to recreate the popular game Flappy Bird. Our version was developed to run on an FPGA board, with visual output displayed through a VGA monitor.

### Game Mechanics
- **Control**: The game is controlled using the board's left button, which makes a square (representing the bird) 'bounce' or flap through incoming obstacles.
- **Display**: Utilizing a 680x480 pixel grid to render the game.
- **Color Assignment**: Each pixel within this grid is assigned a specific color to depict the bird, obstacles, and background.

### Technical Implementation
- **Frame Refreshing**: The game refreshes frames by iterating through every pixel, updating the display to reflect the bird's movement and obstacle progression.
- **VGA Output**: Output is handled through the board's VGA port, projecting the game onto an external monitor.

### Lab Significance
This lab was not only a test of our technical skills in using Vivado and Verilog but also a creative challenge in recreating a well-known game on a hardware platform. It provided a practical application of digital design concepts and a fun way to demonstrate our learning progress.

This project showcases the versatility of FPGA boards and the power of Verilog in creating interactive and visually engaging applications.
