## Project Description

This project involves two primary components:

1. **Triple Adder Configuration**:
   - Combined three adders to sum together two 3-bit values.
   - The output is a 4-bit digit, representing the result of this addition.

2. **7-Segment Display Conversion**:
   - Implemented seven Look-Up Tables (LUT4) to convert the 4-bit output.
   - The converted output is then displayed on a 7-segment display on the board.
