# Logic Design Projects - Verilog Code
Welcome to my repository containing Verilog (.v) source files for various projects completed during my Introduction to Logic Design. These projects were originally developed using Vivado and programmed onto a Basys 3 FPGA board.

## About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to showcasing my Verilog coding skills and the practical applications of these skills in digital logic design. The focus is on the Verilog code itself, therefore, only the .v files are included here. Each project demonstrates different aspects of digital logic design, ranging from basic logic gates to more complex digital systems.

## Project Overview

Each project in this series focuses on a different aspect of digital logic design, progressively building on the concepts learned. Below is an overview of each project:

### Full Adder
- **Description**: An introductory project to familiarize with simple expression implementation.
- **Key Learning**: Understanding basic digital logic operations.

### Multiplexer
- **Description**: Implementation of multiplexers using basic expressions.
- **Objective**: Grasp the fundamental concept behind multiplexers in digital circuits.

### Flip Flop
- **Description**: A rudimentary implementation of a flip flop in a counter design.
- **Application**: Demonstrates the use of flip flops for state retention and counting mechanisms.

### Reflex Game
- **Description**: A comprehensive project that combines basic logic design and state machines to create an interactive reflex game.
- **Features**: The game includes various states indicating win or lose outcomes and is interactable through the board.

### Turkey Counter
- **Description**: A system using two laser sensors connected to the board to count turkeys passing through the lasers.
- **Implementation**: Focuses on sensor integration and counting logic.

### Flappy Bird
- **Description**: A complex project that replicates the Flappy Bird game, utilizing a VGA connection to a monitor.
- **Technicalities**: Involves using arrays for x and y coordinates, implementing coloring logic for each pixel, and managing collision detection.
- **Control**: The game is controlled through inputs on the board.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Xilinx Vivado (for code compilation and simulation)
- Basys 3 FPGA Board (for implementation, not required for code review)
