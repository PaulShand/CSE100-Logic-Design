# Logic Design Course Projects - Verilog Code
Welcome to my repository containing Verilog (.v) source files for various projects completed during my Logic Design course. These projects were originally developed using Xilinx Vivado and programmed onto a Basys 3 FPGA board.

## About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to showcasing my Verilog coding skills and the practical applications of these skills in digital logic design. The focus is on the Verilog code itself, therefore, only the .v files are included here. Each project demonstrates different aspects of digital logic design, ranging from basic logic gates to more complex digital systems.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Xilinx Vivado (for code compilation and simulation)
- Basys 3 FPGA Board (for implementation, not required for code review)
