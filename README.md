# Logic Design Projects - Verilog Code

Welcome to my repository, which contains Verilog (.v) source files for various interactive projects completed using a Basys 3 FPGA board and its I/O components.

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my Verilog coding skills and the practical applications of these skills in digital logic design. Each project demonstrates different aspects of working with digital circuits, focusing primarily on the Verilog code.

## Project Overview

Below is an overview of each project included in this repository, each highlighting a different aspect of digital logic design:

### Reflex Game
- **Description**: This project combines basic logic design with state machines to create an interactive reflex game. The game utilizes a counter displayed on a 7-segment display, with the goal being to press a button at precisely the right time.
- **Features**: Includes multiple game states that indicate win or lose outcomes, interactively managed through the FPGA board's input.

### Turkey Counter
- **Description**: A practical application using two laser sensors connected to the board to count turkeys as they pass through. The challenge lies in implementing logic to accurately count only when a turkey has completely passed from one end to the other.
- **Implementation**: Focuses on integrating sensors and developing robust counting logic suitable for real-world applications.

### Flappy Bird
- **Description**: A more complex project that replicates the popular Flappy Bird game using a VGA connection to display the game on a monitor.
- **Technicalities**: This project makes extensive use of arrays for managing x and y coordinates, applies coloring logic to each pixel, and includes collision detection to enhance gameplay.
- **Control**: Controlled via inputs on the Basys 3 FPGA board, providing a tactile interaction with the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Xilinx Vivado**: Required for code compilation and simulation.
- **Basys 3 FPGA Board**: Necessary for implementing the projects, although not required for code review.
