# Project Description

## State Machine-Based Turkey Counter Simulation

### Lab Objective
The primary goal of this lab was to develop a simulated turkey counter using a state machine. The concept involved counting turkeys as they pass through a corridor, with the original design intending to use laser detectors for counting.

### Implementation
- **Simulation with Buttons**: Due to the unavailability of laser detectors, we simulated the counting process using buttons.
- **Display Features**: 
  - The board displays the total number of turkeys that moved either right or left (counted as positive or negative).
  - It also shows the duration each turkey was detected in front of the 'laser' (button).
- **Reuse of Previous Code**: We efficiently reused code from a previous lab, adapting it to fit the requirements of this project.

### Challenges and Achievements
- **Design Freedom**: One of the main challenges was the lack of a predefined design, requiring us to conceptualize and build the system from the ground up.
- **Project Significance**: This aspect of creative freedom made this project particularly engaging and my favorite, as it allowed for a deeper exploration of system design and state machine application.

This lab not only tested our ability to repurpose existing code but also challenged our creativity in system design, resulting in a unique and enjoyable learning experience.
