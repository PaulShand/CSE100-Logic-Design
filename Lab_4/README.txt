Implement Flip Flops within our logic in order to create a counter which allows it to hold a value, make it go
up, down, count up on itâ€™s own and load a value onto. The Flip Flop within the lab had multiple
uses in order to create the counter. The first use was making the counter using 16 flip flops with
one flip flop for every bit value in the number. Using logic expressions the bit would either go up
or down or stay still depending on input given. Flip Flops were also used as edge triggers when
pressing the buttons. Finally, it was also used mainly to sync up the whole system to run all
together with a clock.
