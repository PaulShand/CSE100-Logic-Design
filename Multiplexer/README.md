## Project Description

## Full Adder and Hexadecimal 7-Segment Display

### Full Adder Design
- Constructed using two 4-to-1 multiplexers.
- Capable of performing addition operations effectively.

### Hexadecimal 7-Segment Display
- Utilizes seven 8-to-1 multiplexers for display.
- Each multiplexers connected to a segment

### Functionality
- The system displays an 8-bit number on the board.
- It can add a 2-bit number to this 8-bit number, ensuring proper execution and carry out.

This project demonstrates the integration of digital logic components to perform arithmetic operations and display results in a user-friendly format.
