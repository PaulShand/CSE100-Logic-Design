This lab objective was to learn how to implement modules into a top level module
reusing sub level modules. For this specific Lab we ended up building a full adder to add up a 7
bit value into a hexadecimal number. We ended up stacking three full adders each taking in 3
bits and in total outputted a 4 bit number. We then made a 7 segment converter to take this 4 bit
number and translate it onto the board into a 7 segment display
