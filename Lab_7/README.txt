This Lab was our last major lab where we utilized everything we learned about
vivado and verilog. Within the lab our main goal was to recreate flappy bird using the board's
vga output onto a monitor and the button Left in order to make a square bounce through an
obstacle coming at the bird. This was done by assigning a specific color to each pixel in a 680
by 480 rectangle and refreshing the frames every time the program has gone through every
pixel.
